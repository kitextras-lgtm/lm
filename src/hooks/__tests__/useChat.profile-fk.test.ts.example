/**
 * Regression Test: Profile Foreign Key Constraint
 * 
 * This test would have caught the bug where getOrCreateAdminConversation
 * attempted to create a conversation without ensuring the customer profile exists.
 * 
 * To use this test:
 * 1. Install test framework: npm install -D vitest @testing-library/react
 * 2. Add to package.json: "test": "vitest"
 * 3. Rename this file to useChat.test.ts (remove .example)
 * 4. Adjust mocks based on your Supabase client implementation
